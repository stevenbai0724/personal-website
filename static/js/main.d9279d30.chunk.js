I wouldn't say it was entirely luck, because there were many things I worked very hard on over the years and I was able to display them on my AIF. This included my achievements in piano and swimming, as well as significant web development work from internships, hackathons and personal projects such as this website. Computer engineering @ Waterloo is my second choice (behind computer science @ Waterloo) and I am totally satisfied with it. Recently I have just been cruising with 80's in my classes and getting back into web development which I previously put on hold.
