First years have a guaranteed spot for campus housing while upper years usually have to find housing off-campus. The different styles of housing are generally split into traditional and suite style housing, with traditional having communal bathrooms and cafeteria food only and suite style with private bathrooms and kitchens. Both styles offer single or shared bedrooms and we are basically given a random one by sheer luck. I got extremely lucky and ended up living in "

Everything in my suite went smoothly, my roommates were very fun and respectful of each other’s space. The only slight issue about UWP is that everyone’s living space is isolated so we’re all just doing our own thing and it’s harder to party and meet people as compared to traditional housing. It is also very expensive compared to most off-campus places. In comparison, I found a very new 5 bedroom suite with 2.5 bathrooms and a kitchen for $900 a month with utilities included, which works out to be slightly cheaper and having much better living conditions than all of campus housing. Nonetheless, I got extremely lucky with the Waterloo Housing lottery and I loved the experience."

    return "It’s a common belief that Waterloo life is boring, antisocial, stressful and everyone here is an absolute nerd. After my 1A term I can say that there is a lot of truth to that but it also depends on how you make the most out of the Waterloo experience. I sometimes talk to new people in lectures, school clubs or the gym. I quit competitive swimming during the pandemic and I started powerlifting at the gym which I find is a very fun and important hobby to balance stress from school and coop searching. I go to the main gym (PAC) or the smaller residence gym (CMH) at least 5 times a week even when I am busy with school, and it has helped a lot with my physical and mental health. Living on campus makes eating very convenient, I can eat wherever, whenever and whatever the hell I want! I gained more than 5 lbs during the 4 months, but hopefully in lean muscle mass since I consistently hit the gym. I also joined the poker club but only went for a few meetings because the games ran very late. I noticed that my friend group is much smaller than it was in high school but I still find it very enjoyable to study, eat food and go to the gym with my fellow math faculty nerds who all share very similar interests. Waterloo students are also very lucky to have a bus terminal on campus as well as the FedBus (literally a bunch of school buses) which leaves on Friday and returns on Sunday. The FedBus can take me home to Toronto or even to Western University where I can see my girlfriend for the weekend, and return on Sunday for a very affordable price. Overall, I managed my time well and found lots of time to relax, socialize and enjoy myself at University, and I feel very lucky and grateful to have had an amazing first semester experience."
