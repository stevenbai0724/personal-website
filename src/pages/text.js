First years have a guaranteed spot for campus housing while upper years usually have to find housing off-campus. The different styles of housing are generally split into traditional and suite style housing, with traditional having communal bathrooms and cafeteria food only and suite style with private bathrooms and kitchens. Both styles offer single or shared bedrooms and we are basically given a random one by sheer luck. I got extremely lucky and ended up living in "

Everything in my suite went smoothly, my roommates were very fun and respectful of each other’s space. The only slight issue about UWP is that everyone’s living space is isolated so we’re all just doing our own thing and it’s harder to party and meet people as compared to traditional housing. It is also very expensive compared to most off-campus places. In comparison, I found a very new 5 bedroom suite with 2.5 bathrooms and a kitchen for $900 a month with utilities included, which works out to be slightly cheaper and having much better living conditions than all of campus housing. Nonetheless, I got extremely lucky with the Waterloo Housing lottery and I loved the experience."

After my 1A term I can say that there is a lot of truth to that but it also depends on how you make the most out of the Waterloo experience. I sometimes talk to new people in lectures, school clubs or the gym. I quit competitive swimming during the pandemic and I started powerlifting at the gym which I find is a very fun and important hobby to balance stress from school and coop searching. I go to the main gym (PAC) or the smaller residence gym (CMH) at least 5 times a week even when I am busy with school, and it has helped a lot with my physical and mental health. Living on campus makes eating very convenient, I can eat wherever, whenever and whatever the hell I want! I gained more than 5 lbs during the 4 months, but hopefully in lean muscle mass since I consistently hit the gym. "

Waterloo students are also very lucky to have a bus terminal on campus as well as the FedBus (literally a bunch of school buses) which leaves on Friday and returns on Sunday. The FedBus can take me home to Toronto or even to Western University where I can see my girlfriend for the weekend, and return on Sunday for a very affordable price. Overall, I managed my time well and found lots of time to relax, socialize and enjoy myself at University, and I feel very lucky and grateful to have had an amazing first semester experience."

The first 2 weeks of Calculus were brutal, since they started teaching the hardest topic of the course right away in an attempt to “weed out” students. We learned the formal ε-δ definition of limits and writing basic proofs right away and it was a very different way of looking at math compared to anything I’ve done before. Furthermore, I was assigned a professor who went very quickly and did not do a good job at explaining things. It was very overwhelming at first and I struggled to follow along during lectures. Things were looking very bad early into my 1A term!"

We had weekly quizzes each worth around 2% each, a midterm exam worth 30% and a final worth 50%. The weekly quizzes were actually easy because there would be practice questions and mock quizzes very similar (sometimes exactly the same) as the actual quiz, and it would suffice to just finish all of the assigned weekly work. Understanding the content was difficult in the first weeks and I used the course notes and some videos to study, but Math137 gradually became easier and more similar to high school calculus. I eventually stopped going to lectures in November when I realized that it was more effective to read the textbook notes and practice questions on my own time. The quizzes and exams were all very straightforward with a few tricks here and there."
